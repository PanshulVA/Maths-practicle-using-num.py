# ALL THE PRACTICLES OF MATHEMATIICS FOR COMPUTING SEMESTER 1
## Dependencies
Python 3.13.7  
Numpy Library  
Sympy Library  
### THE PRACTICLES
1. Create and transform vectors and matrices (the transpose vector (matrix) conjugate
a. transpose of a vector (matrix))  
2. Generate the matrix into echelon form and find its rank.  
3. Find cofactors, determinant, adjoint and inverse of a matrix.  
4. Solve a system of Homogeneous and non-homogeneous equations using Gauss
a. elimination method.  
5. Solve a system of Homogeneous equations using the Gauss Jordan method.  
6. Generate basis of column space, null space, row space and left null space of a matrix
space.  
7. Check the linear dependence of vectors. Generate a linear combination of given vectors
of Rn/ matrices of the same size and find the transition matrix of given matrix space.  
8. Find the orthonormal basis of a given vector space using the Gram-Schmidt
orthogonalization process.  
9. Check the diagonalizable property of matrices and find the corresponding eigenvalue
and verify the Cayley- Hamilton theorem.  
10. Application of Linear algebra: Coding and decoding of messages using nonsingular
matrices. eg code “Linear Algebra is fun” and then decode it.  
11. Compute Gradient of a scalar field.  
12. Compute Divergence of a vector field.  
13. Compute Curl of a vector field.
